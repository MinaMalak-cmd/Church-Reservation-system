2)Delete Stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE stpDeleteMemberByMemberID   
    @MemberID int  
AS  
BEGIN  
    -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from  
    -- interfering with SELECT statements.  
    SET NOCOUNT ON;  
  
    Delete from tblMembers  
    where MemberId = @MemberID  
      
END  
GO

sp_v1:
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteWeeklyReservation 
  AS
  BEGIN

 
CREATE PROCEDURE CallProcAtMidNight
 AS
BEGIN  
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    --  For executing the stored procedure at 12:00 P.M
    declare @delayTime nvarchar(50)
    set @delayTime = '24:00' -- 00:00

    while 1 = 1
    begin
        waitfor time @delayTime 
        begin
            --Name for the stored proceduce you want to call on regular bases
            execute [DatabaseName].[dbo].[StoredProcedureName];
           
        end
    end
END

-- Sets stored procedure for automatic execution.
sp_procoption    @ProcName = 'CallProcAtMidNight',
                @OptionName = 'startup',
                @OptionValue = 'on'
